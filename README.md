# Terraform/OpenTofu for Pterodactyl wings

This repository contains a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)/[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) module for creating a [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) wings node on [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) using [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/).

The system is built, to require modifictaion in a single file, to spin up as many nodes as you want.

To get started, see the [Requirements](#requirements) section for required software and accounts.  
Then see the [Start](#start) section for how to run the script.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)/[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) 1.6.0+ | [Guide](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/)
* A [Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) account with an API token | [Guide](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/)
* A Domain name hosted at [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) with an API token | [Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)
  * Use the template for "DNS:Edit" when defining the privileges for the token.
* A [PteroDactyl panel](https://pterodactyl.io/) with an API key | [Guide](https://dashflo.net/docs/api/pterodactyl/v1/)
  * The API key needs to be an Application API key.

## Start

*Clone the repository and enter the directory.*

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudlan-tools/cloudlan-tools
cd cloudlan-tools
```

The Pterodactyl wings node project is located in `terraform/pterodactyl-wings-node`.  
This is the directory you should be in, when running the commands. To enter, run:

```bash
cd terraform/pterodactyl-wings-node
```

From here, you need to set up the `tfvars/data.tfvars` file, following the [configuration](#configuration).  
[See below](#run-the-script) for how to run the script.

### Run the script

To set up the `tfvars/data.tfvars` file, you can either copy the `tfvars/template.tfvars` file manually or run the following command:

```bash
cp tfvars/template.tfvars tfvars/data.tfvars
```

Then you can edit the `tfvars/data.tfvars` file, to fit your needs.  
There is a lot of documentation already present in the file, but you can also read more about the variables in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

To run the script, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize the project
tofu init

# Optional, get the plan before applying
tofu plan -var-file tfvars/data.tfvars 

# Apply and deploy infrastructure
tofu apply -var-file tfvars/data.tfvars

# Destroy infrastructure
tofu destroy -var-file tfvars/data.tfvars
```

*To use Terraform instead of OpenTofu, replace `tofu` with `terraform` in the commands above.*

## Configuration

To run the application, a `tfvars/data.tfvars` file is required.  
A template for this file can be found in `tfvars/template.tfvars`, which includes all the variables that can be set, with reasonable defaults already set.

### Variables

## Disclaimers

### Pterodactyl API key

The Pterodactyl API key, is sent of to the Hetzner node, through cloud-init.  
This is not an optimal secure way of doing it, but it is the only way I have found to do it. 

We therefore *recommend* that you re-create the API key after the use of this tofu script.
